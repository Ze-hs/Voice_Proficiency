# Voice Proficiency

**Voice Proficiency** is a web application designed to help users improve their communication skills through guided exercises. It allows users to upload video files, automatically transcribe them, and take notes in three distinct modes:

1. **General Notes**: Watch and listen to the video while jotting down observations.
2. **Voice Notes**: Focus on vocal delivery by listening to the audio with the video hidden.
3. **Body Movement Notes**: Analyze physical gestures and posture by muting the audio.

Each mode includes a dedicated notes section tailored to specific aspects of speech improvement.

Inspired by Vinh Giang's masterclass on communication, this application supports practicing core skills such as voice mastery, body language, and storytellingâ€”essential for public speaking, presentations, and effective communication.

## Features

- **Video Uploads**: Upload videos for transcription and analysis.
- **Automatic Transcription**: Powered by AssemblyAI for accurate and efficient transcription.
- **Multiple Modes**: Focus separately on audio, visuals, or both.
- **Dedicated Notes**: Capture detailed insights for each exercise mode.
